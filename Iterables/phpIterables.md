# üìù PHP Iterables
# Introduction
In PHP, an iterable is any data type that can be iterated upon using a foreach loop. This includes arrays, objects implementing the Traversable interface, and the Generator class introduced in PHP 5.5.

# Body
Iterables are particularly useful when working with collections of data, such as arrays or database query results. Using a foreach loop with an iterable allows you to easily iterate over the data and perform some action on each element. Here is an example of iterating over an array using a foreach loop:

```php

$myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

foreach ($myArray as $element) {
  echo $element . "\n";
}
```
In this example, the $myArray variable is an array containing the numbers 1 through 5. The foreach loop iterates over each element in the array and outputs it to the console.

You can also create your own iterables using the yield keyword and the Generator class. Here is an example of a simple iterable that generates a sequence of numbers:

```php

function myGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
  yield 4;
  yield 5;
}

foreach (myGenerator() as $element) {
  echo $element . "\n";
}
```
In this example, the myGenerator function is an iterable that generates the numbers 1 through 5 using the yield keyword. The foreach loop iterates over each element generated by the iterable and outputs it to the console.

# Conclusion
Iterables are a powerful feature in PHP that allow you to easily iterate over collections of data using a foreach loop. In addition to arrays, you can also create your own iterables using the yield keyword and the Generator class. By using iterables, you can write more expressive and maintainable code that is easier to read and understand.
