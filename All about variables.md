### What it is 
Variables are "containers" for storing information.


### Syntax 
In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
##### A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
##### A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
##### A variable name cannot start with a number
##### A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
##### Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

$text = 'This is variable';


### Use case

##### local
##### global
##### static

### Global variables
