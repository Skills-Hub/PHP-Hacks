# PHP Destructor :gear:
Welcome to the guide on PHP Destructor! In this guide, we will explore the basics of using destructors in PHP classes.

Introduction :wave:
In object-oriented programming, a destructor is a special method that is called when an object is destroyed. Destructors are used to perform any necessary cleanup before an object is removed from memory.

Creating a Destructor
To create a destructor in PHP, you use the __destruct() method. This method is called automatically when an object is destroyed.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;

    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    public function __destruct() {
        echo 'The ' . $this->make . ' ' . $this->model . ' was destroyed.';
    }
}
```
# Using a Destructor
To use a destructor in PHP, you simply create an object of the class and then unset it to destroy it.

```php
$myCar = new Car('Honda', 'Civic', 2010);
unset($myCar); // Outputs 'The Honda Civic was destroyed.'
```
# Default Destructor
If you do not define a destructor in your class, PHP will provide a default destructor that does nothing.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;
}
```
# Conclusion :clap:
In this guide, we have explored the basics of using destructors in PHP classes. Destructors are an important tool for performing necessary cleanup before an object is destroyed. By using destructors, you can write more organized and maintainable code. I hope you found this guide helpful! :smiley:
