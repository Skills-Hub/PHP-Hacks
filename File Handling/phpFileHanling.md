# 📁 PHP File Handling Blog Post

In this blog post, we will explore PHP file handling and how it can be used to manipulate files on your server.

## 🌟 What is PHP File Handling?

PHP file handling is the process of reading, writing, and manipulating files on your server using PHP. This can be useful for tasks such as creating, updating, or deleting files on your server.

## 💡 How to Use PHP File Handling

To use PHP file handling, you can follow these basic steps:

1. Open a file using the `fopen` function. This function returns a file pointer that can be used to manipulate the file.
2. Use functions such as `fwrite`, `fread`, and `fclose` to write to, read from, and close the file.
3. Use other PHP functions to manipulate the file, such as `file_exists`, `unlink`, and `rename`.

Here's an example of how to use PHP file handling to read from a file:

```php
// open the file for reading
$fp = fopen('example.txt', 'r');

// read the file line by line
while ($line = fgets($fp)) {
    // do something with the line
    echo $line;
}

// close the file
fclose($fp);
```
