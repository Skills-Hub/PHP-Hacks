86. **Service Locator**: The community centre offers a digital kiosk. Residents can locate various services they need, from plumbing to gardening, connecting them to trusted local professionals.

87. **Immutable Object**: A statue commemorating the community's founder stands in the central square. This immutable object remains untouched and unchanged, symbolizing the community's respect for history.

88. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The neighbourhood's layout was conceptualized considering residents' lifestyles. Areas for recreation, tranquillity, and socializing were crafted based on the community's collective needs and desires.

89. **Aggregate Root**: The main community hall acts as an anchor, hosting events, meetings, and celebrations. Every other shared space in the neighbourhood branches out from this central root.

90. **Object Spreading**: The Andersons, inspired by open interiors, have seamlessly spread their living space into their garden, creating a flowing indoor-outdoor living experience.

91. **Fluent Setter**: Within the Turner family's home, their smart home system allows them to set various device preferences seamlessly. For example, they can adjust the thermostat to a specific temperature while simultaneously dimming the lights, creating a cohesive environment tailored to their liking.

92. **Dependency Container**: Mrs. Hernandez runs a neighbourhood nursery. Her greenhouse is a dependency container wherein she provides all the essential elements plants need to thrive, from sunlight and water to specific soil mixtures.

93. **Object Hydration**: On hot days, community members often gather at the public pool. Just as they rehydrate themselves with a cool swim, in software, object hydration refers to populating an object with data.

94. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: The community's security team operates discreetly. They monitor the neighbourhood, intervening only when specific security-related scenarios arise, similar to how AOP focuses on specific concerns within the software.

95. **Mixin**: Some homes in the community blend styles from various eras, integrating different architectural elements into a cohesive design. It's like adding multiple distinct features or behaviours to a class.

96. **PSR Standards**: The community's construction guidelines ensure all houses adhere to certain safety and aesthetic standards, much like how PSR standards ensure consistency in PHP coding.

97. **Autowiring**: The Martin's house has a sophisticated system where devices automatically detect and establish connections with each other. For instance, when their car enters the driveway, the garage door opens automatically without any manual setup.

98. **Object Serialization**: Ms. Kelly, a local artist, creates miniature replicas of community homes. These models, like serialized objects, capture the essence of the original, presenting them in a different, transportable form.

99. **Object Deserialization**: During a community exhibition, residents can use AR glasses to view these miniatures in life-size form, visualizing the homes as if they were real, akin to converting serialized data back into a usable object.

100. **Factory Method**: The neighbourhood playground was built modularly. Depending on children's preferences, play modules like swings, slides, or seesaws can be added or removed, similar to the Factory Method which provides an interface for creating instances of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate.


101. **Event Listener**: During a community event, they've set up a microphone system. Whenever someone speaks into the mic, the sound system automatically amplifies their voice. This is similar to an event listener, which waits for a specific event to occur and then executes a corresponding function. 
    * **What**: A mechanism that captures specific occurrences.
    * **Why**: To allow an immediate and appropriate response when a particular event happens.
    * **When**: Whenever there's a need to automatically react to certain stimuli or actions.
    * **How**: By continuously monitoring for the event and having predefined responses ready.
    * **Who**: The community event organizers and in the tech world, software developers.

102. **Immutable Object**: There's a time capsule buried in the community park. Once sealed and buried, its contents can't be changed - it's a snapshot of a moment in time. Similarly, an immutable object is one whose state cannot be modified after it's created.
    * **What**: An entity that remains constant post-creation.
    * **Why**: To ensure data integrity and prevent unintended alterations.
    * **When**: In situations where consistency and unchangeability are priorities.
    * **How**: By designing it such that once set, its internal data can't be modified.
    * **Who**: Historians, for time capsules; programmers, for designing certain software components.

103. **Middleware**: At community events, there are several checkpoints attendees pass through - registration, security, ticket verification, etc. Middleware in software acts similarly, processing requests between the user and the application.
    * **What**: Intermediate layers that process data between two endpoints.
    * **Why**: To perform various operations, such as authentication or logging, before the application receives the data.
    * **When**: Typically in web servers or applications that need to process data in stages.
    * **How**: By introducing functions or procedures that data passes through sequentially.
    * **Who**: Event organizers for ensuring smooth flow; developers for efficient data processing in apps.

104. **Lazy Initialization**: Some homes in the community have modern gadgets that only turn on when they detect movement or are specifically called upon. Similarly, lazy initialization in software ensures that an object is only created when it's explicitly needed.
    * **What**: A process where instantiation is deferred until required.
    * **Why**: To conserve resources and optimize performance.
    * **When**: In situations where creating an object is resource-intensive, and it's not certain the object will be needed.
    * **How**: By setting conditions for object creation based on actual demand.
    * **Who**: Homeowners keen on energy efficiency; developers focused on optimization.

105. **State Pattern**: In the community hall, there's a digital display board that changes its message based on various events - whether it's a birthday party, town hall meeting, or a holiday. This resembles the State Pattern, where an object's behaviour changes based on its internal state.
    * **What**: A design pattern allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes.
    * **Why**: To allow an object to represent many states and change behaviours accordingly.
    * **When**: When you have an object that needs to change its behaviour without changing its class.
    * **How**: By encapsulating state-specific behaviours in separate objects.
    * **Who**: The community hall management; software designers working on dynamic applications.

106. **Strategy Pattern**: In the large community house, homeowners can choose different strategies to heat their homes, whether through traditional furnaces, modern heat pumps, or solar panels. What heating method they use depends on their preference, budget, and ecological stance. The strategy pattern in software mirrors this. It allows an application to select an appropriate algorithm from a family of algorithms based on the context. By doing so, users benefit from the flexibility of choosing the most suitable approach for their needs.

107. **Decorator Pattern**: Imagine a basic, well-built house in the community. While the house is functional, homeowners often add decorative elements like paint, wall arts, or window dressings to enhance its appearance. This customization doesn't change the structure of the house but adds value. Similarly, the decorator pattern allows additional responsibilities to be added to an object dynamically, without altering its structure. It helps developers in extending functionality and is especially handy when modification of individual objects is required.

108. **Adapter Pattern**: Think of a house in our community built with European electrical outlets, but most of its residents have devices with American plugs. They use adapters to connect their devices without changing the house's wiring. The adapter pattern in software serves a similar role. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a middle-ground interface. This provides a means for reusing existing code in a new context, bridging the gap between two disparate interfaces.

109. **Observer Pattern**: In a household, when the doorbell rings, various members might react: the homeowner checks the door, the dog barks, and the baby might wake up from a nap. They've all 'subscribed' to the doorbell event and act when it's triggered. The observer pattern works on a similar principle in software. An object maintains a list of its dependents and notifies them of state changes, ensuring that interested components in a system remain updated without direct coupling.

110. **Memento Pattern**: Remember the old houses with layers of paint, where each layer represents a different era or family that lived there? Scratching the surface reveals the house's history, each layer a saved 'state'. The memento pattern is akin to this in software. It provides a mechanism to capture an object's internal state such that it can be restored later. This can be immensely useful in applications like word processors, where users might want to revert to a previous state of their document.


111. **__clone**: In the community house, when a homeowner loves a piece of artwork so much, they might commission a replica for another room. This replica, while a close match, is distinct from the original. The `__clone` method in programming embodies this concept, allowing developers to create a duplicate of an object. Why would someone do this? Cloning objects is useful when you want to make modifications without affecting the original object. It's done whenever there's a need for object replication, like when working on a draft of an object, and the original should remain unaffected.

112. **__invoke**: Consider a multifunctional house gadget that, when pressed, turns on the lights, but when rotated, tunes the radio. The primary action, pressing, is so intuitive that everyone knows it will turn on the lights. In software, objects using the `__invoke` method can be executed as functions. Why have such a design? It offers a straightforward way to use an object when its primary purpose is clear. Developers use it when they want to simplify an object's main operation and it's usually done by experienced developers familiar with this somewhat advanced technique.

113. **__toString**: In some houses, there's a plaque near the entrance detailing the home's history. Anyone who reads it gets a summarized understanding of the house's past. The `__toString` method serves a similar function in programming. It provides a way for developers to get a readable representation of an object when it's treated as a string. It's vital for debugging and logging purposes, helping developers understand an object's state at a glance.

114. **__get and __set**: Picture a house with a smart mailbox. While it looks like an ordinary mailbox from the outside, inside, there are compartments that automatically sort letters, bills, and parcels. Residents don't need to know the inner workings; they just retrieve their mail. In programming, `__get` and `__set` methods offer a controlled way to access and modify object properties. They're used when developers want to intercept and perhaps validate or log property access or changes, maintaining object integrity without necessarily exposing the intricate workings to users.

115. **__isset and __unset**: In the community house, there's a magical wardrobe. When someone wants to know if a specific attire is inside, the wardrobe lights up if it's present. But if they wish to remove an item from existence, they merely voice the command, and the clothing vanishes. In programming, `__isset` checks if a property is set, while `__unset` eliminates a property. Developers employ these to dynamically check or remove attributes of objects, providing flexibility in handling properties without directly accessing them.

116. **__sleep and __wakeup**: Imagine a house with an advanced security system. Before the homeowners leave for vacation, they activate a "vacation mode," where only essential systems run to save energy. When they return, a single button press restores the house to its normal state. In the programming world, `__sleep` and `__wakeup` methods represent this idea. The `__sleep` method preps an object for serialization (like the house going into vacation mode), excluding any unnecessary parts. `__wakeup`, on the other hand, restores the object when it's unserialized. Why is this important? To save resources and ensure smooth transitions when storing or retrieving objects from databases or other storage mechanisms. Developers often utilize these methods in applications where object serialization is frequent, like in caching systems.

117. **__call and __callStatic**: In our community house, there's a special room which adapts to any activity—be it a cinema night or a yoga class. If the activity is not predefined, the room will ask the user for specific settings. Similarly, in programming, `__call` and `__callStatic` methods respond to method calls that don't exist on an object or its class. They are useful when developers want to catch undefined method calls dynamically, adding flexibility and adaptability to classes. These are typically seen in frameworks or advanced OOP systems where the aim is to create adaptable objects.

118. **Late Static Binding**: Imagine a multi-story house with an open design concept. When someone shouts an announcement on the ground floor, people on all floors hear it. But, if someone on the second floor responds, they're responding as a "second-floor resident," and their perspective is considered. In the realm of programming, Late Static Binding is analogous to this. It allows static methods in a class hierarchy to refer to the called class, not necessarily the defining class. This grants flexibility and is often a cornerstone of more advanced OOP design patterns. 

119. **Object Cloning**: In our house, there's a machine that creates a near-exact replica of any item placed into it. This is handy for things like creating extra chairs for guests or duplicating a favoured ornament. In programming, object cloning allows for the duplication of an object while keeping them distinct entities. It's pivotal when developers want to work on a version of an object without altering the original, like testing changes without affecting the base version.

120. **Type Hinting and Type Declaration**: Imagine visiting a house where each room's entrance clearly indicates what can and should be inside, like "Books Only" for a library or "Cooking Ingredients" for the kitchen. This makes it clear what belongs where. In programming, Type Hinting and Type Declaration act similarly, specifying the expected data types for function parameters or return types. This ensures that the data being passed around is of the expected type, reducing errors, and making the code more robust and self-documenting.


121. **Reflection**: Consider a house with smart mirrors that not only show reflections but also provide insights about the room or object in focus, like the age of a piece of furniture or the origin of a painting. Reflection in programming similarly provides the ability to inspect and gather details about classes, methods, and properties at runtime. Why do we need this? Developers utilize reflection for tasks like object introspection, generating documentation, or dynamically creating instances. When building extensible applications, like plugins or frameworks, reflection is essential to examine the components and adjust behaviour dynamically.

122. **Object Aggregation**: In our grand house, there's a master key that doesn't directly open doors but holds a set of individual keys for various rooms. This master key aggregates all the keys, making them easier to manage. Similarly, Object Aggregation in programming involves an object called an aggregator that 'contains' multiple other objects. This structure is used when one object needs to be formed out of several other objects. For instance, when modelling a car, a "Car" object might aggregate objects like "Engine", "Wheels", and "Lights", letting developers work at the level of the whole car while still having access to its individual parts.

123. **Object Composition**: Visualize a room in our house made entirely from modular blocks: walls, floor, ceiling, and even furniture. Need a window? Remove a block and replace it with a window block. Object Composition in programming follows a similar concept, where a class is designed using objects of other classes rather than inheriting properties and behaviours. Why? Because it offers flexibility. A change in one module doesn't drastically affect others, leading to more maintainable code. Designers and developers favour composition over inheritance when they want to ensure their software remains adaptable to changing requirements.

124. **instanceof Operator**: In the house, there's a smart device that identifies any item placed under it—telling whether it's a kitchen utensil, a book, or a toy. In programming, the 'instanceof' operator serves a similar purpose. It checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface. Why is this crucial? It helps in ensuring type safety and allows developers to execute type-specific operations conditionally. For instance, before performing a task meant for a "Book" object, one might check if the given object is indeed an instance of the Book class.

125. **Union Types**: Think of rooms in the house that have dual purposes: a study room that can also be a guest bedroom or a dining area that doubles as a dance floor. Union Types in programming allow variables to hold values of multiple types. Why is this feature helpful? It provides flexibility. Instead of being limited to a single data type, functions can accept or return values that belong to any of the types specified in the union, making it easier to work with diverse data without having to write separate functions for each type.


126. **Type Declaration**: In our sprawling house, there are labelled drawers for specific items: "Silverware," "Documents," "Toys," etc. These labels ensure that we place the correct items in the appropriate drawers. Similarly, Type Declaration in programming allows developers to specify the type of data a function should receive or return. Why is this necessary? It ensures data consistency and prevents errors by ensuring that incorrect data types aren't mistakenly used. When you need to ensure specific data types are used for operations, Type Declaration comes into play, ensuring the software functions as expected.

127. **Nullsafe Operator**: Imagine a butler in our house who, before fetching any item, first checks if it exists. If it doesn't, he simply moves on without causing a fuss. The Nullsafe Operator in programming works similarly. It checks if a variable or object exists (is not null) before trying to access its properties or methods. Why is this operator important? It prevents errors that could crash the application. Developers use it when they're unsure if a particular object or variable might be null, ensuring the program runs smoothly without interruptions.

128. **Property Promotion**: Our house features an automated system where merely specifying a room's purpose (like "study") automatically sets up the lighting, furniture, and ambience to match. Similarly, Property Promotion in PHP simplifies class property definition and initialization. Why use it? For efficiency. Instead of separately declaring and initializing properties, developers can do it in one step. When you're building classes and want to save time and code lines, Property Promotion becomes a handy tool.

129. **Setter & Getter**: In our house, there's a special vault. To add an item, you'd give it to a guardian who checks its validity, and to retrieve, you'd ask the guardian who ensures only authorized retrieval. Similarly, Setters and Getters are methods in programming that control access to an object's properties. Why are they crucial? They maintain data integrity and encapsulation by ensuring only valid data is set and preventing direct, potentially unsafe access to properties. Whenever developers want controlled access to an object's data, they employ setters and getters.

130. **Dependency Management**: Our house is vast, and every room or utility might depend on another. For instance, the lighting system might rely on the power generator. So, there's a caretaker ensuring everything functions in the right order. In programming, Dependency Management tools ensure that software libraries and modules, which a project depends on, are present, updated, and compatible. Why is it vital? It keeps software projects organized, ensuring they have all the necessary components. Whenever a developer embarks on a project, they rely on dependency management tools to handle external software parts effortlessly.

131. **Constructor Property Promotion**: In our house, upon the mention of a specific requirement like "dinner for two", the dining room instantly gets prepared with two plates, candles, and the necessary ambience. This act of mentioning and setting up simultaneously is reminiscent of Constructor Property Promotion. In PHP, this feature allows properties to be declared and assigned within the class constructor. Why is it handy? It saves time and reduces repetitive code. Whenever developers wish to streamline their class constructors and property assignments, this feature is employed.

132. **Composition over Inheritance**: Imagine our mansion has an extensive garden. Instead of inheriting an entire existing garden blueprint (which might include unwanted elements), we choose specific elements we love—maybe a fountain from one blueprint, or a maze from another. This act of composing our garden is akin to the principle of "Composition over Inheritance" in programming. It suggests using multiple simple objects (composition) rather than relying on a hierarchy (inheritance). Why? For flexibility and avoiding problems associated with deep inheritance chains. Developers employ this principle when they want a more modular and easily maintainable structure.

133. **Fluent Interface**: Within our house, there's a room where, once you start an activity, like reading, everything else aligns automatically—lights adjust, a bookmark appears, and a do-not-disturb sign activates. This sequence of related actions is analogous to a Fluent Interface in programming, where you can chain methods in a single statement. Why use it? For readability and elegance in code. Whenever developers wish to craft a sequence of operations in a more intuitive manner, they might opt for this design approach.

134. **Proxy Pattern**: Think of a personal assistant in our mansion who interacts on our behalf—taking calls, filtering guests, etc. They represent us, much like the Proxy Pattern in programming. It involves using a placeholder to control access to an object. Why? For various reasons, including delaying the object's creation cost or adding access control. Whenever developers need an intermediary layer for object interaction, they use this pattern.

135. **Command Pattern**: In our house, we have a digital assistant. You voice out a command like "lights out," and it gets executed. The mechanism behind it, translating a request to an action, resembles the Command Pattern. It allows requests to be encapsulated as objects, decoupling the sender from the receiver. Why? For flexibility in operations and queuing requests. Developers turn to this pattern when they want to parameterize objects with operations or delay, schedule, and log requests.


136. **Chain of Responsibility**: Imagine a multi-storied mansion where, when a visitor rings the doorbell, the ground floor attendant listens. If they can't handle the visitor's request, they pass it to the first-floor attendant, and so on, up the chain until someone can handle it. This system is akin to the Chain of Responsibility pattern in programming. What is it? A way to decouple the sender from the receiver by letting multiple objects handle the request. Why use it? To reduce the coupling between classes. When is it used? When there's a set of related yet varied tasks to handle. How does it work? By chaining the receiving objects and passing the request along the chain. Who uses it? Developers who want to enhance code maintainability and scalability.

137. **Data Mapper Pattern**: Picture a library in our house where you request a book title, and the librarian fetches the exact book from a maze of shelves without you knowing the specifics. This librarian acts similarly to the Data Mapper Pattern. It segregates the in-memory object from the database, acting as a middleman. Why is it useful? It separates the object's responsibilities, ensuring that the business logic remains isolated from the database. When is it employed? Whenever there's a need to keep the domain logic decoupled from the database. How? By using a layer of mappers that moves data between objects and the database. Who implements it? Developers focus on the SOLID principles, especially the Single Responsibility Principle.

138. **Repository Pattern**: In our mansion, imagine a wine cellar with a vast collection. Instead of wandering aimlessly, you ask a specialist, who knows the exact location of each wine, to fetch your choice. This specialist resembles the Repository Pattern. It offers a simplified API to retrieve domain objects based on certain criteria. Why? To centralize the logic of accessing data sources. When do developers use it? When they want a clean separation between the domain and data mapping layers. How? By having a repository intermediary between the domain and data mapping. Who benefits? Developers aim for a cleaner architecture and testable code.

139. **Value Object**: Suppose in our house, every time you describe your favourite room setting, the house magically replicates it. This specific setting, like "dim lights with soft jazz music", is immutable and signifies a particular state, akin to the Value Object in programming. It represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity, ensuring that every instance of a value object is immutable. Why is it crucial? To ensure system consistency. When is it employed? When a simple, immutable object is required to represent certain attributes. How? By defining objects based solely on their attribute values without a distinct identity. Who uses it? Developers designing domain-driven designs and focusing on system integrity.

140. **Entity**: In our mansion, there's a special guestbook that's unique and continuously updated. Each guest's signature, carrying a unique identity and a history, mirrors an Entity in programming. Entities have a distinct identity running through successive states. Why are they essential? To represent business objects in a system. When are they used? Whenever a mutable object with a consistent identity is required. How? By creating objects that have an ID and lifecycle. Who employs them? Developers focusing on domain-driven design and modelling real-world scenarios.


141. **Service Layer**: Consider the grand mansion's main hall, where many activities occur, from greeting guests to hosting parties. This central area manages various house services, much like the Service Layer in software, a conceptual layer within a software application that defines the application's boundary and its set of available operations from the perspective of interfacing client layers. Why is it essential? It ensures the separation of concerns, isolating the domain logic from external interfaces. When is it utilized? When applications need to expose a set of operations to various client applications. How? By implementing a layer that mediates between the application's UI and business logic. Who uses it? Developers looking to create scalable, maintainable software architectures.

142. **Lazy Loading**: Picture a vast library in our mansion. Instead of lighting up the entire place all the time, lights only turn on in aisles you walk into. This is similar to Lazy Loading in software, where data, like a piece of information or an object, is only loaded or initialized when it's explicitly requested. Why is this useful? It conserves system resources and improves efficiency. When is it applied? When data loading is resource-intensive, and it's not necessary to load everything at once. How? By delaying the initialization of an object until its first use. Who benefits from it? Developers aiming to optimize performance in resource-heavy applications.

143. **Eager Loading**: In contrast to the library, imagine a dining room where all dishes, glasses, and cutlery are always set on the table, ready for any feast, instead of being brought out course by course. This mirrors Eager Loading, where data is retrieved in anticipation of future requests. Why do this? To reduce future requests, improving efficiency in some scenarios. When to use it? When it's known that the data will be required immediately after fetching. How? By pre-loading related data along with the requested data. Who employs it? Developers aim to reduce the number of database calls or optimize specific use cases.

144. **Object Pooling**: Consider a coat check room in our mansion where guests deposit their coats upon arrival and collect them later. Instead of arranging new space every time, the same slots are reused, mirroring the concept of Object Pooling. What is it? It's a design pattern where a set of initialized objects are kept ready to use, rather than allocating and destroying them on the fly. Why adopt this? It's efficient and resource-saving, especially when object initialization is costly. When is it used? In situations where objects are needed temporarily and can be reused. How? By maintaining a "pool" of objects that are re-used. Who uses it? Developers aiming for optimization in specific performance-critical applications.

145. **Prototype Pattern**: Think of a modular house where rooms are designed based on prototypes, and when a new room is needed, a copy of the prototype room is quickly made. This is akin to the Prototype Pattern, a creational design pattern allowing objects to be cloned. Why is this beneficial? It reduces the need for creating instances from scratch, often saving resources. When to implement it? When object instantiation is more expensive than cloning. How? By defining and creating prototype instances and cloning them when needed. Who employs this technique? Developers looking to avoid the overhead of creating new instances from scratch.


146. **Builder Pattern**: Think of a customized tool shed in the mansion's garden. Instead of buying a one-size-fits-all shed, the owner prefers a step-by-step building process where they select the shed's size, the type of tools it will hold, and even its paint color. This reflects the Builder Pattern. What is it? It's a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using a specific sequence. Why use it? To construct an object that requires multiple steps, ensuring that the process is clear and the final object is consistent. When is it used? When the creation of a complex object needs to be separate from its representation. How? By employing a series of methods that configure and then build the final object. Who benefits? Developers who are working on systems where objects have numerous shared and distinct configurations.

147. **Composite Pattern**: Inside our mansion, there's a beautiful art gallery. Some walls display individual portraits, while others showcase collections of related artworks. The gallery's curator manages both single and grouped artworks similarly. This mirrors the Composite Pattern. What is it? A structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Why is it useful? It allows treating individual objects and compositions uniformly. When is it used? When dealing with objects that can be grouped in hierarchies. How? By having both individual items and their containers implement the same interface. Who uses it? Developers trying to create hierarchical, recursive tree structures of objects.

148. **Mediator Pattern**: Picture a grand ballroom in the mansion where guests communicate not directly, but through an appointed host. This host manages introductions, ensuring that guests interact harmoniously. This is akin to the Mediator Pattern. What is this? It's a behavioural design pattern that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by ensuring that objects don't communicate directly but through a mediator object. Why adopt this? To reduce dependencies between communicating objects, thus enhancing reusability. When is it applied? When there's a need to reduce chaotic dependencies between multiple classes. How? By introducing a mediator that controls the communication logic. Who employs this? Developers aim to simplify and decouple interactions between a set of intertwined objects.

149. **Memento Pattern**: In the mansion's study, there's an intricate clock that, apart from showing time, illustrates the phases of the moon and has an astronomical calendar. If ever the owner needs to adjust it, they use a setting that remembers its previous state, ensuring it can return to it if necessary. This reflects the Memento Pattern. What is it? A behavioural design pattern offering the ability to restore an object to its previous state, which can be useful for "undo" functionalities. Why utilize it? To implement state save and restoration without violating an object's encapsulation. When? Typically, in applications where state rollback capabilities are required. How? By capturing an object's internal state and externalizing it without exposing its internals. Who uses it? Developers creating apps with undo/redo operations or state checkpoints.

150. **Template Method Pattern**: Every morning in the mansion, there's a routine: open the curtains, air the rooms, and water the indoor plants. While each room has its specifics, the overall routine remains consistent. This routine is reminiscent of the Template Method Pattern. What is this pattern? A behavioural design pattern defines the program skeleton in an algorithm in a method of an object but delays some steps to subclasses. Why is it practical? It provides a clear structure for an algorithm, allowing steps to be customized without changing the algorithm's structure. When to employ it? When there are similar tasks with only slight variations. How? By defining a sequence in a base class but letting derived classes implement specific steps. Who benefits? Developers structuring algorithms with changeable parts.
