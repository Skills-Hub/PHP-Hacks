# üìù PHP Static Methods
# Introduction
In PHP, a static method is a method that can be called without an instance of the class. Static methods are useful when you need to perform an action that does not depend on any specific instance of the class.

# Body
To define a static method in PHP, use the static keyword:

```php

class MyClass {
  public static function myStaticMethod() {
    // implementation goes here
  }
}
```
You can then call the static method using the :: operator:

```php

MyClass::myStaticMethod();
```
Static methods can also access static properties of the class:

```php

class MyClass {
  public static $myStaticProperty = "Hello, world!";

  public static function myStaticMethod() {
    echo self::$myStaticProperty;
  }
}
```
You can also use the static keyword to reference the current class in the method body, which is useful when you want to call a static method on the current class:

```php

class MyClass {
  public static function myStaticMethod() {
    static::myOtherStaticMethod();
  }

  public static function myOtherStaticMethod() {
    // implementation goes here
  }
}
```
# Conclusion
Static methods are a useful feature in PHP that allow you to perform actions that do not depend on any specific instance of the class. They are defined using the static keyword, and can be called using the :: operator. Static methods can access static properties of the class, and can also call other static methods on the same or other classes. By using static methods, you can write more modular and maintainable code, and avoid the need to create unnecessary instances of your classes.
